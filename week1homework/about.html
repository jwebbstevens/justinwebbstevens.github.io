        <p class="main-text">Created their UX/UI from concept to completion. I took their initial wireframes and discussed with them some improvements that could be made to create a better experience. I helped them come up with their slogan "Find the YUM", describing their “chef hiring and discovery” startup in a fun and memorable way. I also created "Foods I can't live without" as part of their sign up process, where at the end of entering basic user information, can select food items "They can't live without". This is a fun way to gather data about users to create a better overall UX when using the platform.

        <p class="date">July 2015 - Nov 2015</p>
        <p class="main-text">Designed the second iteration of BYB’s iOS app, Crew Match, an app that helps yacht captains find crew for their international trips. Went over initial iteration of the app and recommended improvements to create a better experience for both job seekers and creators. Took the initial iteration and my recommendations to design a prototype in PIxate, a mobile prototyping app. During this process, I came up with an innovative solution for the settings menu - when a user switches between features, the settings menu also changes to correspond with the particular feature they’re currently in. This eliminated unnecessary steps if the user wanted to change settings in the feature they were in.

        <p class="date">Dec 2014 - July 2015</p>
        <p class="main-text">At the beginning of 2015, I worked as a digital marketing manager for Coqui Content Marketing, a remote content marketing agency. I managed a team of 5 designers and developers, managed projects, collaborated on projects and hired others to be apart of my team. During this time, I put together almost 100 infographics for around 5 different clients who requested my services through the content marketing agency. I also designed a site for a Kids Allergy Awareness client and designed a way for parents to search through recipes based on a their child's allergies, something the site hadn’t done before.

      <p class="main-text">My overall goals are to continue learning to code and to learn something new every single day. I want to bring the passion I have for what I do, put it into every project I take on and surround myself with others who share the same passions for creating the best UX possible. I enjoy working with teams, bouncing ideas of one another to eventually come up with the best solution, that’s my ideal environment and is where I thrive.</p>
