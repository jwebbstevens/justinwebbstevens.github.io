        <h1 class="company" style="color: #276cd6;">Alton Lane</h1>
        <p class="date">2014 - 2015</p>
        <p class="main-text">I led the Operations team across the company, country and continents for Alton Lane as well as its International Supply Chain and Logistics elements. As a small apparel brand Alton Lane has to rely on process and systems to scale its business. I helped the founders and the team members understand the critical need for scalable processes and scalable enterprise applications. The company is founded on a few simply principles, a better experience and a better fit. With an extremely small but talented team I expanded the company's footprint from four revenue channels to 11, including stores in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Richmond, Mobile, NYC (Flagship), Washington and a E-commerce channel which I laid the ground work for to 3X revenue over the previous year to a $1.2 mm in sales, with 3X the sales growth MoM in December alone. </p>

        <h1 class="company" style="color: #00a651;">Quirky, Inc.</h1>
        <p class="date">2012 - July 2014</p>
        <p class="main-text">I joined Quirky to re-energize the company's use of NetSuite and re-establish the application as the system of record and action for the Finance, Operations and Logistics teams. Originally using the application just for numerous Journal Entries, I helped the team understand how enterprise relational databases work. I established, optimized, and maintained numerous connections between the platform and outside partners such as the company's two 3PL's, the internal E-commerce platform as well as the EDI application SPS Commerce offered. Joining the company at employee number 60 and moving on after employee 200 joined was a heck of ride with an Andreessen backed startup fundamentally changing how inventors and the products they create are brought to market. Quirky truly is changing how the market thinks about invention.</p>
